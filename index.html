          This `main` element acts as a container for our content.
          - `bg-white`: Sets a white background color.
          - `p-8 md:p-12`: Adds padding, which increases on medium screens and above for better spacing.
          - `rounded-lg`: Gives the container slightly rounded corners.
          - `shadow-2xl`: Adds a prominent shadow to make the container stand out.
          - `max-w-lg`: Limits the maximum width of the container to prevent it from getting too wide on large screens.
          - `w-full`: Makes the container take up the full width on smaller screens.
          - `text-center`: Centers the text inside the container.
